Originally just an assignment for my CIS-121 (Data Structures) class to write two AI's that could beat the TA bots, I decided to take it a step further and made my bots as could as I could conceive.

TODO
-Make it so that when the Ninja hears the Pirate, rather than assigning a new destination immediately, instead find the point where he would be equidistant from all paths worth taking. (Similar idea should be applied to Pirate. Deterministic strategies can't be allowed.)
-Clean up code.
-Stop using static variables just to serve Visual.
-Redo getMidpoints() to NOT use getDifferences() (it's significantly slower).
-Optimize code so that caching isn't necessary if possible.
-Follow up on original blog write-up.
